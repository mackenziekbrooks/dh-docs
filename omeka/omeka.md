# Getting Started with Omeka

Omeka is an open-source content management system for building online exhibits. Omeka is designed to work with cultural heritage materials.

## Access
Login to Omeka by adding /admin to the end of your Omeka URL. 

## Structure
In Omeka, you have three pieces of organizational structure: 1) items 2) collections and 3) exhibits. 

An item can be a photo, a document, a video, or a newspaper article. Each item must have metadata, or descriptive information about that item, such as title, creator, date, source, publisher, etc. Omeka uses a metadata standard called Dublin Core. 

Items are grouped thematically into collections. For example, a collection could be all photographs from a particular photo album or all the documents from one person's desk. 

Exhibits consist of items with added text, context, and narrative. You can bring in items from any collection to tell the story of a particular historical event. Each exhibit can have multiple pages or sections, and on each of those pages you have options for how to arrange content. 

## Documentation
[Omeka.org](http://omeka.org/codex/Documentation) should have all the documentation you need for working with Omeka. You can also find some tutorials on [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit).

I recommend the following pages:
* [Site Planning Tips](http://omeka.org/codex/Site_Planning_Tips)
* [Working with Dublin Core](http://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core)
* [Project Planning Case Studies](http://omeka.org/codex/Project_Planning_Case_Studies)

Check out the library's [Finding and Using Images](http://library.wlu.edu/research/images/) page to help with finding media for your exhibit.
