<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One person in your group should have a Twitter account. That person should log into TimeMapper using the Login link in the top right corner. The TimeMap will be associated with that student's Twitter account.</li>
<li>Everyone should have and be logged into a Google account. It's helpful if one student takes the lead in the set up.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the <a href="http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/create">Create page</a>. Click on &quot;the template&quot; link to open a Google Spreadsheet template.</li>
<li>In the template spreadsheet, go to File &gt; Make a copy to save a copy of the spreadsheet to your own Google Drive. Rename that spreadsheet something appropriate to your project.</li>
<li>In your new spreadsheet, go to File &gt; Publish to Web. Then click Start Publishing.</li>
<li>In your new spreadsheet, click on the blue &quot;Share&quot; button and share the spreadsheet with your classmates.</li>
<li>Return to the Create page on the TimeMapper website. In their Step 2, you should be able to press the &quot;Select from Your Google Drive&quot; button and find your new spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Fill in the rest of the form with information appropriate to your project. Pay attention! You cannot redo the title/URL of your TimeMap. You would have to delete and start over (not too bad).</li>
<li>After you filled in the form, press Publish! This will be the published form of your TimeMap. You can share this URL with your professor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li>To add entries to your Timemap, you add rows to the Google spreadsheet. This is great for collaborative work because Google keeps track of your revision history, just in case someone edits your work. Go to File &gt; See revision history to view previous versions of your spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Rows should be in chronological order.</li>
<li>TimeMapper makes it easy to cite your sources. If you use media, make sure you give credit to the author. The media you use needs to have a URL that ends in an image extension like .png or .jpg.</li>
<li>TimeMapper needs GPS coordinates to render the locations on the map. There is a formula in Column K for looking up the geocoordinates based on the location entered in Column J. With your cursor on the little blue box in the bottom right-hand corner of the cell, drag down the contents of those first coordinates to copy the formula to the rest of the spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
